Solutions to the excellent yearly Advent of Code puzzles - https://adventofcode.com
I'll try to solve the previous years before 2022's Advent of Code. No set language - I'll just use whatever I feel like. Mostly want to try Go and Rust though. Wish me luck :) 

Pm me if you want to participate - links in bio.
